DOWNLOAD ROUTER PRO - Free
Download Router Pro automatically organizes your downloads based on source domain rules.

Instead of dumping everything into a single default Downloads folder, this extension 
routes files into specific subfolders depending on the website they came from.

Download Router Pro supports three routing modes:

    📁 DEFAULT DOWNLOAD → SUBFOLDER
    Files redirect to custom subfolders inside Downloads.

    💾 DEFAULT DOWNLOAD → ANOTHER DRIVE (via Junction)
    Files save to external drives (G:, D:, etc.) using Windows junctions.

    ☁️  DEFAULT DOWNLOAD → CLOUD DRIVE (via Junction)
    Google Drive/OneDrive when mounted as local drives.

No manual sorting. No drag-and-drop cleanup.

FAQ
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. What is a junction?
A Windows junction is a link that redirects one folder location to another.  
It allows your Downloads folder to point to another drive without copying files.

Example:  
Downloads/Resume → G:\MyDrive\Resume  
Note: Files are physically stored on G:, not on C:.

2. How do I connect Google Drive or another cloud drive?
1. Install the official desktop sync app (Google Drive, OneDrive, etc.).  
2. Ensure the cloud storage appears as a local drive on your system.  
3. Create a junction from your Downloads subfolder to the mounted drive location.

Once mounted, routing works like any other drive.

** IMPORTANT NOTES
    1. Junction setup is required for external or cloud routing.  
    2. Deleting the junction does NOT delete files stored on the target drive.  
    3. The extension does not upload, copy, or access file contents. It only redirects download paths using Chrome’s downloads API.

3. How it help-full for Job Seekers
If you download resumes from Overleaf or similar platforms, this extension automatically separates each version into a specific folder — either in a local subfolder or another drive (including cloud drives if mounted).
