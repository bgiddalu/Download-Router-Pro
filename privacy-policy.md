Privacy Policy for Download Router Pro
Effective Date: February 21, 2026

Download Router Pro is a Chrome extension that automatically routes downloaded files into user-defined subfolders based on source domain rules.

1. Data Collection
Download Router Pro does not collect, store, transmit, or sell personal information.
The extension operates entirely on the user's device and does not use external servers.

2. Information Processed Locally
To perform its routing function, the extension temporarily accesses:

• File name (used to determine destination folder)  
• Chrome Downloads API metadata

This information is processed locally and is not transmitted outside the user's device.

3. Data Storage
The extension uses Chrome's storage permission to store:
• User-defined domain → folder routing rules
• Optional local target path text for junction guidance

This data is stored using Chrome Sync Storage and is not shared with any third party.

4. Permissions Used
downloads – Modify the download file path before saving
storage – Save and retrieve user-defined routing rules

The extension does NOT access:
• Browsing history
• File contents  
• Personal communications
• Location data
• Financial information
• Authentication credentials

5. Junction Feature
